Known issues in repmgr
======================

* The check for whether ``wal_keep_segments`` is considered large enough
  does a string comparison rather than an integer one.  It can give both
  false positive (setting is large enough but flagged as too small) and
  false negative (setting is too small but not noted as such) errors.

* When running repmgr against a remote machine, operations that start
  the database server using the ``pg_ctl`` command may accidentally
  terminate after their associated ssh session ends.

* After running repmgrd as a regular foreground application, hitting
  control-C causes the program to crash.

Planned feature improvements
============================

* Before running ``pg_start_backup()``, a sanity check that there is a
  a working ssh connection to the destination would help find
  configuration errors before disturbing the database.
